# Monte Carlo for Pi
[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fdschmidt/MonteCarloForPi/master)

A Jupyter Notebook that uses a Monte Carlo Algorithm to determine the value of Pi.

## Description
The code uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the value pf pi by generating random points with x in [-1, 1] & y in [-1, 1] and determining whether they lie within the unit circle or not. The obtained pi is compared to numpi.pi and the random points are plotted to visualize the distribution.

As a bonus, the code can also be run until a specific level of accuracy (again compared to numpy.pi) has been achieved.
